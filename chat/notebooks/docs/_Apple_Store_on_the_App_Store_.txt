    Super easy and fast

I have used the Apple Store to upgrade my watch , IPad, and IPhone and it was very convenient.  I definitely recommend ordering online and picking up at a nearest Apple Store.   I recently upgraded my IPhone two weeks ago. I ordered online for the trade in and picked it up at the nearest Apple Store during the window times that was available to me.   There was no wait to pick up phone. I was in and out of the store within 6 min.    Mailed my old phone back and the whole trade in process was complete within a few days .   My IPad and Apple Watch was ordered online and mailed to me for trade in and I had no issues. I have the series 7 watch and IPad 6.  I definitely will use the store for future apple product purchases.

    iPhone is getting worse

Bought the iPhone 13â¦worse iPhone in years. Constant bugs, requires way too much screen touching to get anything done. To delete an app you have to tap three different times! Face ID is stupid about half the time so youâll have to punch in your passcode. Face ID and double tapping the side button to make a purchase is twice as stupid. Flashlight and camera buttons are in a bad location and constantly turning on. The internal App Library is worthless and groups apps together that donât make sense. The internal search almost never gives the desired results. If you donât have a Bluetooth device connected there is no red decline or âhang upâ on the screen so your phone is pretty much taken hostage during an incoming call that you donât want to answer. I still have many other complaints to add, but Iâll stop because you probably get the point so hereâs the thing. I seriously donât understand how Apple could take what was once a good product and just spiral down the rabbit hole to the point that users are left with a product that seems straight out of wonderland.

    The Apple Store won't let me buy an Apple Watch with my Apple ID balance

I am very disappointed that Apple does not give me an electronic device on the app store for my savings which is on the ID balance.  I purchased 19 Gift Cards worth $460 to purchase an Apple Watch in the future and activate it on the same day to complete the purchase.  I have all receipts and cards confirming the purchase of the Gift Card in stores.  Apple offers the consumer when buying a GIF Card to make purchases in the App Store purchased MacBook phone iPad Apple Watch headphones.  But in reality this is not the case.  Apple blocks device purchases but allows subscriptions.  I trusted this company and was disappointed in it because it deceived me.  I spent a lot of time talking with operators who each time they transferred me to another operator, I changed five operators in 2 hours of conversation and none of them solved this problem.  I drove up to the official Apple store and they didnât help me there either, they gave me a phone number and said call the customer service in the same place where I called all this time.
